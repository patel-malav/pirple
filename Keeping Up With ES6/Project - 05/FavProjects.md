# The Projects That I would like to work on are as follow

1. [p5.js] (https://github.com/processing/p5.js) ‚≠ê
2. [uppy] (https://github.com/transloadit/uppy)
3. [fullPage.js] (https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)
4. [Phaser] (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
5. [p5 play] (https://github.com/molleindustria/p5.play/) (A game development lib.)

## I would like to focus on p5.js because its a thing I keep returning back to after react, vue to make
## some stuff that is not an full fledged application i.e. to visualize sorting, make funky greeting card maker etc.
